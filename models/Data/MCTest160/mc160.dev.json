{"story": "Douglas loves to play soccer. He plays for the Dolphins. He is very good. He was excited about the big game with the Lions. The night before the game, he went to bed late. He was watching three TV shows that night. First, was Muffins the Cat. The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey. The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster. His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen. He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night. First about sheep jumping fences. Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal. Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired. His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face. Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast. Then he quickly dressed into his uniform. He was yawning. His Mom drove him to the soccer field. The game had started. Douglas had to sit out the first quarter. His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions. Douglas started the second quarter. He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team. The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow. Usually he was fast. After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep. The third quarter started. Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in. When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game. Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two. Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face. Douglas got up and stretched. He was finally well rested. The coach saw Douglas and sent him into the game.

{"story": "It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake. On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to \"say\" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the \"where are you\" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour.

{"story": "It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake. On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to \"say\" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the \"where are you\" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this.
